## House Price Prediction
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

## Problem statement

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:

-Actinic keratosis
-Basal cell carcinoma
-Dermatofibroma
-Melanoma
-Nevus
-Pigmented benign keratosis
-Seborrheic keratosis
-Squamous cell carcinoma
-Vascular lesion

## Data Augmentation
Multiple augmentation techniques were used and generated images were added to database to increase the number of images and rebalance.
The following is an example of augmented images.  ![Augmented Dataset ](Resources/augmented_image.png)

## Conclusions
Multiple models of CNN were build to find an optimum solution. The final model has around 80% test and train accuracy.
